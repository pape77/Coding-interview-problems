Given an array of integers with duplicates, return the Kth most common element in the array.

For example:

Given { 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 5, 4, 3, 2, 5, 4, 3, 5, 4, 5 } and K=  2

Since 5 appears 5 times, 4 appears 4 times, 3 appears 3 times, 2 appears 2 times and 1 appears 1 time, the 2nd most common element is 4.
